title: The Secret History of Las Vegas is a New York Times Editors Choice
category: news
---

The *New York Times* singles out books they've reviewed of "particular interest" and The Secret History of Las Vegas was recently named [**Editors Choice**](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/02/books/review/editors-choice.html).

In the original review, Marcel Theroux said
> “The Secret History of Las Vegas” is, among other things, a bold appropriation of a defining piece of Americana. The Nigerian-born Abani is the author of novels set in Lagos, London and Los Angeles. His writing has the scope of a person who has lived and imagined widely. America is refracted through the eyes of a global citizen, someone who can write with equal confidence about sea monkeys, Twinkies, shebeens in Soweto, the etiology of personality disorders and the logistics of getting an injured prostitute out of a Las Vegas hotel.
