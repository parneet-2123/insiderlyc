title: Reviews coming in for The Secret History of Las Vegas
---

Getting some nice Review coverage of *The Secret History of Las Vegas*. Here are a couple recent ones from the *LA Times* and *The New York Times Book Review*

> "What lifts the novel is its energy, the audacity of Abani’s imagination, and most of all the breadth of vision that supplies its moral context. *The Secret History of Las Vegas* has a global sweep and – what’s often aspired to, but rarely achieved in a novel – a feeling of thematic unity."
-- Marcel Theroux, *New York Times Book Review*
 
 [*New York Times Book Review*](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/26/books/review/chris-abanis-secret-history-of-las-vegas.html?ref=review)
 
 
> "It's Tony Hillerman as filtered through J.M. Coetzee, a moving, strange and savagely funny book."
-- Marc Weingarten, *Los Angeles Times*
