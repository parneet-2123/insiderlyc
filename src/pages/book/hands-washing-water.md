Hands Washing Water is Chris Abani's fourth poetry collection—a mischievous book of displacement, exile, ancestry, and subversive humor. The central section, “Buffalo Women,” is a Civil War correspondence between lovers that plays on our assumptions about war, gender, morality, and politics.

**Sweetest Henri,**  
**I know we promised to be honest,**  
**one to the other, but your recent missive,**  
**though welcome as any epistle from you,**  
**filled me with a dread that clung**  
**like dampness to wet wood. I am terrified**  
**for your immortal soul, dear sweet Henri.**  
**This mad war of Lincoln is infecting you**  
**with a sickness too depraved to even address. . .**

Abani’s writing is ruthless, at times traumatic, and consistently filled with surprising twists and turns.
